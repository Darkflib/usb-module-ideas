# USB module ideas

Recently framework have brought out a new line of laptops. These use a removable usb-c module that plugs into recessed slots in the chassis.
This means that you can change what modules you install into your laptop as your needs change.
So far there are modules for:
* Hdmi
* Displayport
* Usb-c
* Ssd
* SD card

And more promised

The idea is good and they promise to open source the spec for the modules.

This said, here are some additional ideas for modules.

* SDR
* inertial measurement unit
* GPS
* serial port
* Esp32/arduino
* cryptographic co-processor
* Zigbee
* Lora
